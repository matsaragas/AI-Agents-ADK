      "helpful_assistant > The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and management of AI agents. It provides a flexible and modular approach to building AI agents, treating agent development more like traditional software development. ADK is optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem but is model-agnostic and compatible with other frameworks. It enables developers to create complex agentic architectures, from simple tasks to intricate workflows, by offering features such as multi-agent orchestration, tool integration, and built-in evaluation tools.\n",
